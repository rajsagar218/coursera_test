    <h1 style="color: green; font-size: 60px; text-align: center;">If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together</h1>
    <p style="margin: 0 100px 0 100px; font-size: 1.5em;">Teamwork makes the dream work and this is what Tata believes as well. While alone you might walk faster and reach the destination quicker, together one can walk and far and achieve more. There is so much more one can achieve when they have a solid support system and people around them who they can trust and rely on. No matter how brilliant you are, if you are alone you might not achieve what a great team can achieve when they are working towards a common goal with passion and dedication. Treat your team right and it might just be the one things which can help you achieve greatness.</p>
    <p>If you want to walk fast, walk alone. But if you want to walk far, walk together.</p>
